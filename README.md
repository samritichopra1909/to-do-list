A to-do list web app is a digital application designed to help users organize and manage their tasks, activities, or goals. Users can create a list of items they need to accomplish, set priorities, mark completed tasks, and often organize tasks by categories or due dates. The web app typically provides a user-friendly interface where users can easily add, edit, and delete tasks. Some advanced features may include task prioritization, due date reminders, categorization, and collaboration options for sharing lists with others. The primary goal of a to-do list web app is to enhance productivity and help users stay organized by providing a centralized platform for managing their tasks efficiently.
